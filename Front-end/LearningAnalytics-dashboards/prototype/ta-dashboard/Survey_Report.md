# Introduction

To gain a better understanding, we at PAWS lab carried out a survey asking current and former Teacher Assistant (TA) on what a they are looking for in a dashboard application. We will use the responses gathered from the survey to determine our first prototype. PAWS Lab will be integrated initially into the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh; thus the targeted demographic of TA's is those who has taught computer science classes. At the time of writing this report, there has been a total of 26 completed surveys with an additional 9 responses that are in progress. We will divide this report into different sections: Background Information, Support Tools,

# Background Information

In this section, we wanted to gain some information on who the taker of the survey is such as age, school, gender, etc. This is to see if there is a correlation between their background (i.e. gender) and how they teach a recitation/lab. At the time of writing this, we have a split of 21-4-1 (Male-Female-Other), most who fall into the category as undergraduate student. Furthermore, we wanted to see how a lab/recitation were conducted. This means how the class time is divided up, how do they assist students who needs help, and if they know their students. Based on the feedback, we now know that for all gender groups, they use about 60% of their time to work on assignments, 25% to have a recap/teaching session for the class, and the remainder 15% of the time for other activities such as taking attendance, speaking with students, etc. However, 92% of TA's that completed the survey told us that they have little to no knowledge about their students when it comes to their background (as we described to be i.e. previous classes they have taken, and how well they master topics). It seems to be problematic that TA's use a good bit of time working with students, but not knowing how their students are performing in the class overall. When it comes to how a TA approaches the student when they need help, the majority seems to answer somewhat the same: breaking the problem down and give pointers to the student. It would seem to be a good idea to implement this approach into the dashboard, as nearly 40% are highly confident in their approach, with another 46% being moderately confident (note that our approach is a generalization of the majority's approach). If we filter the responses based on gender, we do not find any significant difference in responses for this category. So far, only 23% of TA's in our survey stated that they have previously used a dashboard application, where all believed that it helped their teaching abilities.

# Ranking

Next, we wanted input on what tools they find most useful when being a TA. We gave the TA's a list of actions to perform for the class, a list of indicators for individuals’ students and asked them to rank them based on significance. For the class overall, the top 5 popular answers were that TA's would like (1) to know the concepts the student is struggling with, (2) swing common mistakes, (3) identifying low performing students, (4) subgroups of students facing similar problems, and (5) a list that shows student that asked for help. like the answer for the entire class, for the list of individual students, the top 3 answers were (1) common mistakes made, (2) Estimated knowledge level, and (3) number of mistakes on each learning activity. One hypothesis on why these are the top answers goes back to the background section of our survey: There might be a correlation between not knowing how their students are performing in the class, and wanting that information presented during their recitation/lab session.

# Support Tools

In this section, we wanted to focus on some support tools we could offer to the TA's, and what they expected from these tools. Starting off, we initially planned that the system would be unique for each lab session, where previous weeks of work were non-significant. However, an overwhelming 63% wants to be able to look at a student’s progress/history dating back to the start of the term. However, the TA's do not want this level of detail to be on the main hub of the application. Here, nearly 50% believes wants to see how the class is progressing, and how individual students are progressing their work. Looking at the traditional dashboards (a table of student-question), it seems like this fits the criteria of what the TA's are hoping to get.
In preparation of creating this survey, we spent numerous weeks gathering information from other research projects on dashboard, where one mentioned that they wanted to add an ability to control the pace of the class. We found this to be interesting and asked if this is something our TA's would like to control. Our findings contradict the original reading where our survey stated that 83% wants the student to have free flow working on the problem (thus not controlling the pace of the class). But answering this does not mean that they do not want to be notified about the student’s pace. In another question, the majority of TA's answered that they want to be notified of the bottom 1 St. dev. if they are falling behind by a large amount. Otherwise, they do not want to be notified if they are on pace or far ahead on the assignment.
Tutoring students
For an explicit list that shows who needs help, we asked our TA's on what order they would like to help students. Surprisingly to me, the majority did not want a "first-come-First-Serve" order of this list (27%), but rather a list that is ordered by how long a student has been stuck on a problem (41%). Still a popular choice with 32%, a large group of TAs wanted a list ordered by how far they have gotten into the assignment. However, we then run into the issue that some students may not request for help, but the system identifies him to be in desperate need of help. Should this student receive help before those who asked? The majority believes that they have the same priority, thus whoever been stuck the longest getting help first. However, the second largest group wants this student to get help first, thus in a tie breaker we should fall to this option (i.e. both students entered the list with exact same time spent on a problem). We then have the problem of knowing where this student sits. As students who does not ask for help is identified to need help, we need to let the TA's know where they are in the classroom (this goes back to TA's not knowing much about their student, thus might not recognize a name to a face).
In the modern world, it seems like simplicity is what people want. This sings true based on our survey. We asked our TA's if they want indicators/logos to pop up when displaying how the student is performing (i.e. different icons for "completed on first try" vs "completed but not on first try". Our response was that these indicators is a nice thing, but only if it is for emergency use to catch the eye of the user of the application.
We also learned that the TA's want a system that allows them to give feedback (informing how students are doing) and additional instruction (providing examples or explanation). both wishes should be able to be fulfilled with a traditional dashboard

# Potential issues

In this section, we asked our TA's about some issues we might have creating this application (i.e. user privacy), and how we could work around it. The first issue we presented was trying to locate the 'at-risk' student. As we have seen already, TA's might not recognize faces and be able to put down their name in their correct seat in the classroom. Thus, we proposed an idea where we allow the teacher to drag and drop the student into their correct spot. This seems like a working solution as the majority of yes/no answered yes.
Next issue would be data-literacy. It has come to our attention that some people may struggle reading graphs and therefore might not want that option. In our survey, after filtering to only see the answer of those who said that they have issues reading graphs, there was an even 50-50 split on keeping graphs simple and adding a descriptive text. However, when including the rest of the TA's, the majority wants to see us adding descriptive text to the graphs
