## Potential Teaching Assistants' Needs for support

* Identifying at-risk students (from [Diana, 2017]).
  (variables: Time spent for each problem (idle?); attempts; running score; Previous lab scores; Predicted score vs actual score;)
  * Identifying where students are struggling (e.g., problems or concepts) (from [Diana, 2017]; [Molinaar, 2017]; [Fu, 2017];).
  * Identify why students are struggling (from [Molinaar, 2017]). 
  
* Identifying students in good stance who could help others (from [Diana, 2017]).
  (variables: number of attempts; actual score; time spent; predicted score; or just has completed all of the assignments early)

* Detect students' pace (from [Molinaar, 2017]; [Fu, 2017];).
  (variables: students avg. time per assignment vs class' avg. time per assignment(Molinaar pg 3))

* How is the class as a whole progressing? (from [Diana, 2017]; [Molinaar, 2017]).
  (variables: average score; average time spent;) <- use this to see if they finish on time??

* Sharing statistics about the class' progression (from [Holstein, 2018];)
  (variables: number of submissions; similarities between answers;)
  * Common mistakes/responses

* "Help Queue": Remember the order of when a student is identified to need help
  (variables: look at "Identifying at-risk students" bullet point)
  * User hits a button asking for help (Idea from reading [Holstein, 2018];)
  * Program identifies an at-risk student (from [Diana, 2017])

## Potential Issues

* User privacy (from [Verbert, 2014])
  * Microphone, camera etc.
  * Where a student is located
    * For locating the identified at-risk student:
      * We must know classroom dimensions (how the classroom is setup)
      * We must know where in the classroom the student sits
  
* Lack of pedagogical knowledge that allow TAs to take adequate actions to help students - that in general instructors have (from [Molinaar, 2017]).

* Lack of data literacy (from [Dollinger, 2018]).

* Color blindness (from [Final Report (previous research team)])

* Data overload - To much data given to the user at once can become distracting and cause issues (from [Martinez-Maldonado, 2019])

## Potential Fixes

* [User Privacy: Location]
  * When a studentis identified to be at-risk, we can display an image or user given location of where they are sitting (from [Martinez-Maldonado, 2019];)
  * During attendance, teacher can 'drag and drop' a student to the correct spot
  * Student can select their seats (trust system)
  * Communication channel between student and teacher
