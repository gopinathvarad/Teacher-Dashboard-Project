## Potential teachers' needs that could be addressed by a Learning Analytics dashboard
* Aiding students with different levels (monitoring, alerting,advising) (Leeuwen,2019)
* Identifying at-risk students (from [Diana, 2017]).
* Capturing students' learning: 
(1) number of problems solved; 
(2) measures of a student's knowledge and knowledge growth; 
(3) effort spent on recent problems (from Bodily,2018); 
(4) students'progress on different learning goals;
(5) correct/incorrect answers students have given on assignments, most common mistakes students have for specific problem (error analysis) (Molenaar,2017)
* Different types of dashboards: lesson overview, class overwiew and progress overview (Molenaar,2017)
* Variables: 
(1) whether the assignment was completed;
(2) how many attempts students/groups needed on the assignment;
(3) whether there was a chance the groups displayed trial-and-error behavior; 
(4) how often each group member talked while working on the assignment (Leeuwen,2019).
* Group student into different knowledge level:
  We group the students by the time they spend on programming, how many compiling errors they fix, and how many exercises they finish in class. (Xinyu, 2017)
* Measure performance for group study. Enable	instructors	to	gain	awareness	of	group	learning	processes,	to	help	them	determine	whether	groups	or	individual	learners	needed	attention.
	The	interface	showed	four	key	facets	of	group	work:	1)	symmetry	of	activity,	2)	degree	of	interaction	with	othersâ€™	contributions,	3)	level	of	collaboration,	and	4)	overall	progress	of	the	task.	(Martinez-Maldonaldo,2015)
	
## Potential Issues

* Lack of data literacy (from [Dollinger, 2018]).
* How to decompose knowledge targeted in instruction (from Bodily,2018).
